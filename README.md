# angular-test-promise
Adds $q promise capability to jasmine or sinon

## Installing

Just run ```bower install angular-test-promise```. This package will work with jasmine (1.x and 2.x) with or without sinon,
as well as mocha using sinon.  For this purpose, no runtime dependencies are specified. This means you will have to install
your mocker of choice yourself.

## Using

Make sure ```angular-test-promise``` is included after your selected mocking framework. New methods will be added:

### Using sinon with sinon-chai

```javascript
var service = {
	loadStuff: sinon.promise();
};

// your promise can be queried lika a spy/stub
expect(service.loadStuff).calledOnce;

// to resolve the promise, call it like this
service.loadStuff.resolve([]);
// and don't forget to $digest since $q promises don't resolve until then
$rootScope.$digest();

// to reject the promise, call it like this
service.loadStuff.reject('Some error occured');
// and don't forget to $digest since $q promises don't reject until then
$rootScope.$digest();
```

### Using jasmine without sinon

```javascript
var service = {
	loadStuff: jasmine.createPromise('service.loadStuff');
};

// your promise can be queried lika a spy
expect(service.loadStuff).toHaveBeenCalled();

// to resolve the promise, call it like this
service.loadStuff.resolve([]);
// and don't forget to $digest since $q promises don't resolve until then
$rootScope.$digest();

// to reject the promise, call it like this
service.loadStuff.reject('Some error occured');
// and don't forget to $digest since $q promises don't reject until then
$rootScope.$digest();
```
